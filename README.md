Introduction

we will be dealing with the Restaurant reviews dataset. In this dataset, there are reviews from the customers which are either positive or negative. And now we are going to build a machine learning model using both Support Vector Classifier(SVC) and Count Vectorizer methods. And finally, this model is going to predict whether the given review is either positive or negative.

Created a webapplication for prediction using streamlit.
